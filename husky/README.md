# Introduction

Husky uses [git hooks](https://github.com/lifeparticle/Git-Cheatsheet/blob/master/README.md#git-hooks)

# Installation

```shell
npx husky-init && npm install       # npm
npx husky-init && yarn              # Yarn 1

## React, Husky, Lint-staged, Es-lint, Prettier, and Eslint-config-prettier

```shell
# create a react app called react-husky with typescript
yarn create react-app react-husky --template typescript
```

```shell
# create a folder called .husky with pre-commit hook script
npx husky-init && yarn
```

The abvoe commands should generate the following code inside the `package.json` file:

`package.json`

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "prepare": "husky install"
  }
}
```

```shell
yarn add --dev lint-staged
```

`.husky\pre-commit`

```
#!/usr/bin/env sh
. "$(dirname -- "$0")/_/husky.sh"

npx lint-staged
```

```shell
yarn add --dev eslint
npx eslint --init
```

```shell

```shell
yarn add --dev --exact prettier
```

Turns off all rules that are unnecessary or might conflict with Prettier.

```shell
yarn add --dev eslint-config-prettier
```

 Add `prettier` to the `extends` array inside the .eslintrc.* file. Make sure to put it last, so it gets the chance to override other configs.
 
 ```json
{
  "extends": [
    "some-other-config-you-use",
    "prettier"
  ]
}
```
